## Project Title: Book Catalog Management System

## Project Description

    You are tasked with building a simple book catalog management system using Ruby on Rails. This system should
    allow users to add, edit, and remove books from the catalog. Each book must have a title, author, genre, and
    year of publication. Users should be able to browse the catalog, and view detailed information about each 
    book.

## Project Requirements

    1. users must be able to sign up and log in to the system
    2. once logged in, users must be able to perform the following actions
        a. view a list of all books in the catalog.
        b. Add new books to the catalog.
        c. Edit details of an existing book.
        d. Remove a book from the catalog.
        e. View detailed information about a specific book.
    3. the book catalog must be stored in the database
    4. the system should perform appropriate validation on book information (e.g., required fields, valid
       publication year)
    5. the user interface should be clean and user-friendly. (No need to have a complex UI. we will be mainly
       focus on the functionality of the system )

## Other considerations

    1. The Ruby on Rails framework should be used to build the application.
    2. use front-end technology of your choice (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    3. use any database of your choice (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
    4. pay attention to code organization, readability, and best practices
    5. implement appropriate error handling and validation messages.
    6. use any gems or libraries you deem necessary.
    
## Deliverables

    1. a complete Ruby on Rails project with all necessary code and configuration
    2. a documentation describing the design choices, assumptions, and trade-offs made during development.

## Evaluation Criteria

    1. Functionality: Does the system meet the specified requirements?
    2. Code quality: Is the code well organized, easy to read, and maintain?
    3. Error handling: Are errors handled gracefully and with appropriate error messages?
